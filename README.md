# jquery livecss plugin

a plugin that aims at webdevelopers who are tired of hitting reload to see the css changes they just made.
it constantly changes a timestamp after the css files in the header forcing the browser to reload them.
so far i only tested it on webkit.

## dependencies
jquery 1.4+

## installation

simply load
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.livecss.js"></script>
```
